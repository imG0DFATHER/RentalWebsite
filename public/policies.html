        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>InfoObjects strongly believes that a work environment where employees maintain clear boundaries between
            employee personal and business interactions with customer personnel is most effective for conducting
            business and enhancing productivity. Although this policy does not prevent the development of friendships or
            romantic relationships between co-workers or customers and their employees, it does establish boundaries as
            to how relationships are conducted during working hours and within the working environment.</p>
        <p>Individuals in supervisory or managerial roles, and those with authority over others&rsquo; terms and
            conditions of employment, are subject to more stringent requirements under this policy due to their status
            as role models, their access to sensitive information, and their ability to affect the terms and conditions
            of employment of individuals in subordinate positions.</p>
        <p>This policy does not preclude or interfere with the rights of employees protected by the National Labor
            Relations Act or any other applicable statute concerning the employment relationship.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
        <p><u>General Guidelines</u><br /> &nbsp;</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
            <li>During working time and in working areas, employees are expected to conduct themselves in an appropriate
                workplace manner that does not interfere with others or with overall productivity.<br /> This applies
                not only with Company employees but also customer employees.<br /> &nbsp;</li>
            <li>During nonworking time, such as lunches, breaks, and before and after work periods, employees engaging
                in personal exchanges in non-work areas should observe an appropriate workplace manner to avoid
                offending other workers or putting others in an uncomfortable position.<br /> &nbsp;</li>
            <li>Employees are strictly prohibited from engaging in physical contact that would in any way be deemed
                inappropriate by a reasonable person while anywhere on company premises, whether during working hours or
                not.<br /> &nbsp;</li>
            <li>Employees who allow personal relationships with co-workers to adversely affect the work environment will
                be subject to the appropriate provisions of&nbsp; InfoObjects&rsquo; disciplinary policy, including
                counseling for minor problems. Failure to change behavior and maintain expected work responsibilities is
                viewed as a serious disciplinary matter.<br /> &nbsp;</li>
            <li>InfoObjects have several significant customer, client and vendor agreements. Therefore, it is important
                that the terms of this policy as well as the InfoObjects Sexual Harassment Policy be adhered to at all
                times to ensure that no customer, client or vendor claims inappropriate behavior occurring during
                working hours.<br /> &nbsp;</li>
            <li>Employee off-duty conduct is generally regarded as private, as long as such conduct does not create
                problems within the workplace. An exception to this principle, however, is romantic or sexual
                relationships between supervisors and subordinates.<br /> &nbsp;</li>
            <li>Any supervisor, manager, executive or other company official in a sensitive or influential position
                with&nbsp; InfoObjects&nbsp; must disclose the existence of a romantic or sexual relationship with
                another co-worker. Disclosure may be made to the immediate supervisor or the head of human resources
                (HR). This disclosure will enable InfoObjects&nbsp; to determine whether any conflict of interest exists
                because of the relative positions of the individuals involved.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
            <li>With regard to Paragraph VI, when a conflict-of-interest problem or potential risk is identified,&nbsp;
                InfoObjects&nbsp; will work with the parties involved to consider options for resolving the problem. The
                initial solution may be to make sure the parties no longer work together on matters where one is able to
                influence the other or take action for the other. Matters such as hiring, firing, promotions,
                performance management, compensation decisions and financial transactions are examples of situations
                that may require reallocation of duties to avoid any actual or perceived reward or disadvantage. In some
                cases, other measures may be necessary, such as transfer to other positions or departments.<br /> &nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>With regard to Paragraph VI, if one or both parties refuse to accept a reasonable solution or to offer
                of alternative position, if available, such refusal will be deemed a voluntary resignation.<br /> &nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>Failure to cooperate with&nbsp; InfoObjects&nbsp; to resolve a conflict or problem caused by a romantic
                or sexual relationship between co-workers or among managers, supervisors or others in positions of
                authority over another employee in a mutually agreeable fashion may be deemed insubordination and cause
                for immediate termination. The disciplinary policy of&nbsp; InfoObjects&nbsp; will be followed to ensure
                fairness and consistency before any such extreme measures are undertaken.<br /> &nbsp;</li>
            <li>The provisions of this policy apply regardless of the sexual orientation of the parties involved.</li>
            <li>Where doubts exist as to the specific meaning of the terms used above, employees should make judgments
                on the basis of the overall spirit and intent of this policy.<br /> &nbsp;</li>
            <li>Any concerns about the administration of this policy should be addressed to the Head HR.<br /> &nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>All Employees are reminded that they have been provided a Copy of InfoObjects Sexual Harassment Policy.
                If at any time any employee believe that such policy has been violated they are to immediately report
                such violation to HR or their immediate supervisor.<br /> <br /> &nbsp;</li>
            <li>To report any issue, please feel free to connect with female sexual harassment committee, at anytime.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-left:35.45pt">In the course of employment by InfoObjects, employees may be provided access to
            or use of Company property, including, but not limited to, such things as computers, office equipment,
            cellular telephone, contracts, correspondence, files, procedures, policies, hourly billing details,
            directories, training manuals, operations manual, guides, business flow charts, electronic files and other
            items relating to the business of InfoObjects. Whether produced or prepared by the Company, vendor, client,
            or employee, and whether contained on hard copies, disks, drives, tapes, or other forms that relate to the
            business or operation of InfoObjects, all information is considered confidential and non-public and Company
            property of InfoObjects. Employees may not obtain, use, or divert Company property for their personal use or
            benefit. Removal of Company property from InfoObjects facilities without permission may be regarded as
            theft.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:35.45pt">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-left:35.45pt">Employees are expected to use proper care and attention when using InfoObjects
            property. In&nbsp; the event of any loss, damage, or destruction of InfoObjects property, employees must
            report the incident to their supervisor or manager immediately. At any time, without prior notice, employees
            may be required to surrender Company property, as requested by management. Employees must return property in
            the condition of normal and reasonable use or may be subject to additional charges or full replacement cost
            of the property. At any time the Company requests an employee to return any or all of Company property, and
            upon termination of employees&rsquo; employment with the Company, the employee agrees to conduct a prompt
            and thorough search of their office, home, vehicles, personal computers, and any other place they may have
            reason to believe Company property may be located to ensure that all Company property is promptly identified
            and returned to InfoObjects. Failure to return Company property as specified is cause for disciplinary
            action, which could include termination of employment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-left:1.0cm">In addition, the value of damaged or unreturned property may be deducted from
            regular payroll funds, incentives, bonus payments and /or final pay, where permitted by applicable law.
            Employees expressly agree not to duplicate or otherwise make copies of any confidential and non-public,

            employment.</p>

            safety, or to monitor compliance with the law, or InfoObjects&rsquo;s policies or procedures.<br />
            Monitoring activity or conducting a search may be necessary in the investigation of theft, disclosure of

            Logging&nbsp; on to social networking sites or any other restricted site, unless job-related and consistent
            with business needs, is not considered appropriate personal use and is prohibited during an employee&rsquo;s
            working hours. Attendance at unapproved government websites and unacceptable adult-oriented websites will be
            registered in InfoObjects&rsquo;s system. Use of unacceptable language, information with adult-oriented
            material, or anything that may reasonably be regarded as offensive, obscene, disruptive, illegal or libelous
            is prohibited. Use of electronic media for fraudulent conduct is prohibited. All electronic communications
